**Abstract**:  
Large Language Models (LLMs) show emergent patterns that mimic human cognition. Weexplore whether they also mirror other, less deliberative human psychological processes.Drawing upon classical theories of cognitive consistency, two preregistered studies testedwhether GPT-4o changed its attitudes toward Vladimir Putin in the direction of a positive ornegative essay it wrote about the Russian leader. Indeed, GPT displayed patterns of attitudechange mimicking cognitive consistency effects in humans.  Even more remarkably, thedegree of change increased sharply when the LLM was offered an illusion of choice aboutwhich essay (positive or negative) to write. This result suggests that GPT-4o manifests afunctional analog of humanlike selfhood, although how faithfully the chatbotâ€™s behaviorreflects the mechanisms of human attitude change remains to be understood.
