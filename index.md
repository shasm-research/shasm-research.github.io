# SHASM: The Science of Human and Artificial Social Minds

## Our Mission
SHASM investigates the intersection of human and artificial social cognition. We explore how humans and AI systems develop, understand, and navigate social interactions. Our goal is to advance the understanding of social intelligence across both natural and artificial minds.

## Join Us
We welcome collaborators and researchers interested in:
- Social cognition in humans and AI systems
- Human-AI interaction and social dynamics
- Cross-disciplinary approaches to understanding social minds
- Development of socially intelligent AI systems

Whether you're a researcher, student, or interested collaborator, we invite you to connect with us and explore potential collaborations.
